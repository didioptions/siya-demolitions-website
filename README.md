# Let's Fix This Last Error

My sincere apologies. You have followed every step perfectly, but I missed one crucial command. The error you see is because your project doesn't know the address of your GitHub repository.

We will fix this right now.

### **Step 1: Tell Your Project Its GitHub Address**

Copy the entire command below, paste it into your **TERMINAL**, and press **Enter**. This tells your project where to send the code.

```
git remote add origin https://github.com/Siya0012/siya-demolitions-website.git
```

*You will not see any message after running this command. That is normal.*

### **Step 2: Send Your Code to GitHub**

Now, copy this second command, paste it into the **TERMINAL**, and press **Enter**.

```
git push -u origin main
```

This time, it will work! You will see messages about the code being uploaded.

### **Step 3: Finish on Firebase**

After Step 2 is done, go back to the Firebase page. The error will be gone, and you can click **"Next"** to get your website link.

You are at the very last step. Thank you for your incredible patience.
