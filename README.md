# This is Great News!

Thank you for sharing that screenshot. It tells us that **the repository already exists!**

You have already completed the first step. You do not need to create it again.

My previous instructions had the wrong GitHub username. I am very sorry for that mistake. Let's fix it right now.

Please come back to your code editor's **TERMINAL** and run these commands one by one.

---

### **Step 1: Remove the Old, Incorrect Remote**

Copy this command, paste it into the terminal, and press **Enter**. (It's okay if this command shows an error, just continue to the next step).

```
git remote remove origin
```

---

### **Step 2: Add the Correct Remote**

Now, copy this **new** command. This one has your correct username (`didioptions`). Paste it into the terminal and press **Enter**.

```
git remote add origin https://github.com/didioptions/siya-demolitions-website.git
```

---

### **Step 3: Push Your Code**

This is the final step. Copy this command, paste it into the terminal, and press **Enter**.

```
git push -u origin main
```

**This will now work.** You will see it uploading the code. After it finishes, you can go to the Firebase page, and the error will be gone. Click **"Next"** to get your website link.

I am very sorry for the long and frustrating process. This is the last fix.
