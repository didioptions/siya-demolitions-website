# Siya Demolitions Projects

My sincere apologies for the confusion. Let's fix this together.

You are seeing an error because you copied the gray box formatting (` ```bash `) along with the command. You should only copy the text *inside* the box.

Let's try again.

---

### **Step 1: Get Ready**

*   You should have the **TERMINAL** panel open at the bottom of your editor. If not, click **"Terminal" -> "New Terminal"** from the top menu.

---

### **Step 2: Run The Commands (One By One)**

Copy the commands **exactly** as they appear below, without any extra text or symbols.

1.  **First Command:** Copy this line, paste it into the terminal, and press **Enter**.
    ```bash
    git add .
    ```

2.  **Second Command:** Now, copy this next line, paste it in, and press **Enter**.
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    ```
    *If you see an error about `user.email` or `user.name`, please run the two `git config` commands it suggests, and then run `git commit -m "Initial commit"` again.*

3.  **Third Command:** Finally, copy this last line, paste it in, and press **Enter**.
    ```bash
    git push -u origin main
    ```

After the last command finishes, your code will be on GitHub.

### **Step 3: Finish Firebase Setup**

Go back to the Firebase page ([https://console.firebase.google.com/project/siya-demolitions-projects/apphosting](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/siya-demolitions-projects/apphosting)), refresh it, and the error will be gone. You can then click "Next" to get your website link.
