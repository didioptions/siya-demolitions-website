# The Final Fix: Create the Repository

My deepest apologies. I now see the real problem, and it is my mistake. You have done everything perfectly.

The error **`Repository not found`** means the online folder for your code on GitHub.com does not exist yet.

Here is how to fix this for good.

### **Step 1: Create the Repository on GitHub.com**

1.  Open your web browser and go to: **[https://github.com/new](https://github.com/new)**
2.  For "Repository name", you must type this **exactly**: `siya-demolitions-website`
3.  Make sure "Public" is selected.
4.  **Do not** check any boxes (like README, .gitignore, license). It must be an empty repository.
5.  Click the green **"Create repository"** button.

### **Step 2: Push Your Code from the Terminal**

Now, come back to your code editor. Copy only this one command, paste it into your **TERMINAL**, and press **Enter**:

```
git push -u origin main
```

**This will now work.** You will see it uploading the code.

### **Step 3: Finish on Firebase**

Go back to the Firebase page, and the error will be gone. Click **"Next"** to get your website link.

Thank you for your incredible patience. This is the last step.
