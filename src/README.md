# How to Get Your Website Link

You are very close! Let's get this done together.

There are two steps left. **Please do them in this order.**

### **Step 1: Publish Your Code to GitHub**

You must do this step inside your **code editor**.

1.  **Click the Source Control icon** on the left side of your editor (it looks like a fork in a road).
2.  In the text box at the top, type the message: **`Initial commit`**
3.  Click the blue button below that says **"Publish Branch"**.

This will send your code to your empty GitHub repository.

### **Step 2: Finish Firebase Setup**

Now, go back to the Firebase page in your browser: [https://console.firebase.google.com/project/siya-demolitions-projects/apphosting](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/siya-demolitions-projects/apphosting)

1.  In the box that says **"Choose a branch"**, type: **`main`**
2.  The error message should now be gone.
3.  Click the **"Next"** button to finish.

Firebase will then give you your public website link.
